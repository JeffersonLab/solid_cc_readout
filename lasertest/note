run coda on fevme1 with roc on fevme1
1) ssh clasrun@fevme1 (fevme1 is the computer on the vme crate)
2) killcoda
3) runcontrol -rocs 
4) Connect, Configure->fevme1, click "rocs" view on top right
5) Download->/usr/clas12/release/1.4.0/parms/trigger/clasrun.trg
6) Prestart
7) Go
8) End run
9) Abort

coda rerun only need prestart->go if no config change

coda rerun only need download->prestart->go  if config change

ssh clasrun@clondaq4
diaggui $CODA/src/diaggui/config/fevme1.txt 
click "Ch SCope", choose "ch 1 > 1000 and ch 2 < 500" as trigger by clicking on channel name
choose "AdcParameters" -> "Dac" to change value
right click on plot to select position to read value

Data will be recorded on clondaq6:/work/duke_data/fevme1_######.evio.#####

(old Data will be recorded on clondaq4:/data/stage_in/fevme1_######.evio.##### 
because coda mix-use fevme1 and clondaq4 for its large mem)

how to take laser run data
hvon   (wait for 2 mins)
cd bin
./RUNME_duke.sh
hvoff

hvstatus (will show voltage in V and current in uA, if a line is disconnected,voltage is none-zero but current is zero)
hvoff
hvon (default 1000V) 
hvon 900 (turn all 3 HV to 900V)
lvstatus
lvoff
lvon

FPGA needs 5-5.5V LV, need to measure it when plugin at connector to make sure it is above 5V after voltage drop by cable
Don't unplug LV when power on, it will trigger CAEN V power supply
CAEN LV powersupply is noisy, use a tabletop powersupply to avoid it.
Set tabletop powersupply current limi to 1A for 1 FAPG board.

if HV/LV is not response, 
1. it can be powersupply problem, check server using "caengeco" on clondaq4, connect to ip from "host hvrich0". If unplug LV connector when LV on, it will trip them and has to clear the trip using caengeco to clear alarm before it can be turned on again
2. it can be ioc problem, run "clascss" on clasrun@clonsl1, click RICH->"EXPERT ONLY:HVRICH0 Slot 11, HV A1536", If "status" show red, do "control"->"reboot ioccaenhv_HVRICH0"
3. alternative to 2, in clascss, IOCs->IOC Health->Detectors and then see ioccaen_HVRICH0 with options near the bottom,then "reboot"

Both top and bottom rack use a "T" to connect to laser trigger cable.
If Laser red "on" button on control box is not flashing, it means it's not triggered. check the trigger cable!

RICH laser max freq 1Mhz even though the model can go 120mhz

Laser has to trigger on rising edge as shown on its display! NOT falling edge! otherwise, there is some micro second delay and maroc adc using slow shaper see NO signal

(the commend below only works if interlock is green and they work for both external trigger and internal trigger)
any of the three commands without option show laser status
laser_intense 10 # change laser intensity to 10% (it accepts from 10 to 90 with steps in 10) when "tune" is set as manual instead of auto
(run laser_intense to confirm status)
laser_fr 250 # change laser freq to 250khz, any number > 1000 will set laser to max 1000khz
(run laser_fr to confirm status)
laser 0 # turn laser off
laser 1 # turn laser on
(run laser to confirm status)
When at interal trigger setting, the internal clock TTL is always on no matter laser on or off and interlock green or red.

lts_run 250 50  (move laser to X=250,Y=25 position, align with top row middle slot)

wheel (show current filter status)
wheel 3 (change wheel to 3)

how to take injection run data   
cd bin
./RUNME_injector_duke.sh

For injection run, remove PMT or keep HV off
FPGA is used to input fix amount of charge, both maroc pixel by rich daq and maroc sum signal by fadc and coda can be tested
laser control box is still connected and responds to trigger by FPGA, but laser light is not on, thus interlock or HV is not need)

To take choose delay which give max output signal to test
Inject a amplitude (fix amount of charge) into 1 pixel a time and the output is saved into 1 file in RICH daq.
To record maroc sum with fadc and coda with controlled dead events, use 1khz trigger and do 1 group of 8 pixels at once.
loop through all charge choices and then all pixels.
Fo example, loop through 8 (0-7) pixels with 9 amp (50-4050 with 500 step) with 1000 events at each settting will have 72 setting
Coda has 2 dead events at very beginning, then 9000 events with no dead events, then 10 dead events when chaning pixel every time, then 11 dead events when click "end run" button
So total events are 72083=2+9000*8+10*7+11

safety training

https://www.jlab.org/div_dept/train/RICH/RICH%20Laser.pdf

HV and laser are interlocked with the black box door electromagnet through interlock control box 

laser can only be turned on when interlock is on and will be killed when interlock go from on to off

However, HV can be on even when interlock is off!
interlock from off to on doesn't change HV status and HV is killed only interlock go from on to off!
HV needs some time to drop to 0 even when killed

The big sphere is an addtional way to reduce light

PMT_id or chip_id shown on top left of
https://clasweb.jlab.org/wiki/images/b/b9/Mapmt_ID_and_orientation.pdf
for 3-PMT board, the one near HV is id 0
so in the test setup, most inner one has pmt_id or chip id 2

pixel_id and maroc_id are shown at 
https://clasweb.jlab.org/wiki/images/4/46/Maroc_ch.pdf
Ben did sum connection for bottom left 8 pixels with 
pixel_id 49,50,51,52,57,58,59,60 and 
maroc id  8, 6, 7, 5, 4, 2, 3, 1
then he did it for all pixels

maroc daq has output with id = pmt_id*64 + (maroc_id - 1)
so the most bottom left pixel has id 2*64+(4-1)=131

H12700 with serial number GA0194 gain balance, see "scale" on plots showing distance between peak and pedestal
https://www.jlab.org/accel/RadCon/opsgraphs/rich/webfit/archive/w3_2019/r_W0_GA0194_w3_g064_v1000_t227.60.txt.lin_11par.png
where thresh hold is 227, pixel id 60

gain map is at cfg/gain/
it has gain_map_0.txt,gain_map_1.txt,gain_map_2.txt where pmt_id is used
inside map file,  maroc id is used for line ordering

Topward power supply provide +5V, current limit set at 1V which is larger than 800mV drawn by one board

Be careful insert MAROC and PMT because they are hold by board edge which doesn't match well, FPGA board is quite loose

If no deadtime, coda start with 2 junk events after "Go", 
then add 1 more junk event after no more trigger, then add some other junk event after click "End run", total 4 or more junk events more than trigger
If there is deadtime, coda records more events than trigger

If FPGA pulser is running, start maroc daq with laser will stop it automatically

fadc has 12 bit adc and 4ns sample time window, 50ohm
It can be set at 0.5/1/2V via jumper for each channel from tp to bottom position
at 0.5V, each adc channel has current 0.5/4096/50/1e-6=2.5uA and charge 0.5/4096/50*4e-9=10fC

We choose 48 windows and 192ns total

sum of 8 signal has cut off at 25mV, corresponding adc channel 25e-3/0.5*4096=205 above pedestal
The cut off could be from driving the cable to FADC or before it
If it's from driving the cable to FADC, add an 1x amp to buffer it on board could increase cut off by a factor of 2, but it may increase everything

sum of 8 signal with 10x amp by NIM has cut off at 250mV, corresponding adc channel 250e-3/0.5*4096=2050 above pedestal

NIM crate TTL->ECL converter 
very bottom LEMO input match second to last pin output which should connect to TS#1 in crate with twisted wire and wire polarity switched
